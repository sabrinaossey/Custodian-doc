Introduction

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Swiss Data Science project, including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our community.

This Code of Conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in the Swiss Data Science community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the project, in any project-related activities and especially when representing the project, in any role.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please try to follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and productive environment that enriches the surrounding community.
Specific Guidelines

We strive to:

    Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer to use public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer to a question, it also ensures that any inadvertent mistakes in answering are more easily detected and corrected.
    Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve conflict, and assume good intentions. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
    Be collaborative. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.
    Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may direct them to the appropriate forum. We will try hard to be responsive and helpful.
    Be careful in the words that we choose. We are careful and respectful in our communication, and we take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. We will not accept harassment or other exclusionary behaviour, such as:
        Violent threats or language directed against another person.
        Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
        Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
        Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
        Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history, without the sender’s consent.
        Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
        Unwelcome sexual attention.
        Excessive profanity. Please avoid swearwords; people differ greatly in their sensitivity to swearing.
        Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
        Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.


The Swiss Data Science project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of. Although we may not always be able to accommodate each individual’s preferences, we try our best to treat everyone kindly.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, Swiss Data Science development is conducted in English.
 Participants in our community should uphold these standards in all their interactions and help others to do so as well.
