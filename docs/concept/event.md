# Event Tracking System

This system enables data owners to trace data journey and answer the following questions:
- where is the data hosted (which IAD)?
- what data is being accessed, since when, until when?
- what application has access to the data, from where, and on whom's behalf?
- what post-processing results came out of the data?
- who has access to the results?
- Who tries to access a resource without authorization?

Governance bodies can audit the events and verify that contracts are respected.
The data controllers can use these events to demonstrate compliance with data protection laws. Data providers can define data usage metrics for analyzing data consumption based on these events.
Finally, these events are a source of contextual information for the Policy Information Point (PIP). In the future, we envision an intelligent Adaptive Privacy Based Access Control that uses this contextual information as knowledge to dynamically grant data access based on privacy scores and privacy budget.
