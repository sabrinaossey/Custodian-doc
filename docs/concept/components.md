A Contract workflow as the following step:
1. Contract Template Creation
2. Contract Approvals
3. Contract Signatures

## [Event Tracking System](./event.md)
The event tracking system provides an audit trail of all the events created by the custodian components. It captures each entity and their actions as a Web of relationships in a consistent way. This allows any authorized party to:

- Trace back the ownership of the data ressources.
- Track the use of the data ressources.
- Verify that all actions carried out on these resources conform to the respective owner's rights.
